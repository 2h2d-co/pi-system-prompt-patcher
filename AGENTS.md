# Agent Instructions

- This project is a Pi package with a TypeScript extension entrypoint.
- Pi extensions run with full system permissions; keep side effects explicit and documented.
- Run `npm run check` and `npm test` before committing meaningful code changes.
- Use Conventional Commits and maintain `CHANGELOG.md` in Keep a Changelog style; add entries for `feat:` and `fix:` changes under `Unreleased`.
- Keep changelog entries under `Unreleased` for prereleases and move them into a release section only for stable releases.
- Use `npm run release -- <version>` to build the release locally, record its SHA-256 in an SSH-signed `release: v<version>` commit, prove a clean rebuild is reproducible, and create the matching lightweight tag.
- Push release commits and tags atomically; do not create annotated or signed tag objects.
